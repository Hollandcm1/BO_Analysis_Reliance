# Blue Orange Reliance Analysis

## Description
This project is used to analyze the reliance data from the blue-orange experiment conducted by the Cognitive and Motor Performance Lab (CaMP), running simple ANOVAs and LMEs. After statistical analysis, the data is visualized a few different formats on a group level, broken down by some of the various variables.

## Getting Started
1) Download the project
2) Open an R session 
3) Change your working directory
4) Run scripts

## How to use this project
The analysis doesn't have to be strictly run in order, but it will often help as there may be some bugs that haven't been worked out in terms of making each script independent. At an absolute minimum, the librarys script should be run.
