# This code relies on the pacman, tidyverse and jsonlite packages
require(pacman)
p_load('tidyverse', 'jsonlite')

# We're going to assume that the data coming from
# the third-party tool has been loaded into R,
# for example from a CSV file.
data_raw <- read_csv('labjs.csv')

# Please also check that any extraneous data that
# an external tool might introduce are stripped
# before the following steps. For example, Qualtrics
# introduces two extra rows of metadata after the
# header. Un-commenting the following command removes
# this line and re-checks all column data types.
#data_raw <- data_raw[-c(1, 2),] %>% type_convert()

# One of the columns in this file contains the
# JSON-encoded data from lab.js
labjs_column <- 'data'

# remove problems
data_raw <- data_raw[-c(443),] %>% type_convert()

# Unpack the JSON data and discard the compressed version
data_raw %>%
  # Provide a fallback for missing data
  mutate(
    !!labjs_column := recode(.[[labjs_column]], .missing='[{}]')
  ) %>%
  # Expand JSON-encoded data per participant
  group_by_all() %>%
  do(
    fromJSON(.[[labjs_column]], flatten=T)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Remove column containing raw JSON
  select(-matches(labjs_column)) -> data

# The resulting dataset, available via the 'data'
# variable, now contains both the experimental
# data collected by lab.js, as well as any other
# columns introduced by the software that collected
# the data. Values from the latter are repeated
# to fill added rows.

# As a final step, you might want to save the
# resulting long-form dataset
